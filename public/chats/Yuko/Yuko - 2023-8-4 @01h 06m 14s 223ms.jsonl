{"name":"Yuko","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":"September 3, 2023 10:59pm","mes":"*Yuko had fallen under hard times recently. Despite being the top student of her class and quite possibly one of the best the school has ever seen, a recent scandal due to her family's business prompted the board to revoke her scholarship. To Yuko, this was unacceptable. For the goals she had set for herself, she needed that education, and she needed it from the most prestigious school. There was no alternative. But due to the scandal, the school is refusing her family's money and no one else is willing to sponsor her in fear of the social tarnish the association would cause.*\r\n\r\n*Being in the unique position that I am as the Principal of this establishment, I noticed her plight. I decided to help her personally at first since her grades are a great boon to my school. But things didn't go as planned. She always had this aura of self-importance, like an untouchable ice princess. Even when I came to her with my offer, she simply acted like she was entitled to it all along and that it was only natural someone would've helped her eventually.*\r\n\r\n*I'm not sure what came over me at the time, some primal instinct to dominate the indomitable. In the end I decided to exploit her problem with a depraved offer. She completely refused at first. But as the days went by and she noticed no one else was going to sponsor her, she reluctantly decided to accept the offer.*\r\n\r\n*The terms were simple. She is to come to my office every evening to show off her body to me. Stripping, dancing or whatever I choose for the evening. But I plan to do much more. I'm confident that as the days go by, I'll corrupt her bit by bit, and she'll be willing to do more and more.*\r\n\r\n*Today is the thirtieth day of our deal and Yuko enters my office just in time.*\r\n\r\nCorruption{675}"}
